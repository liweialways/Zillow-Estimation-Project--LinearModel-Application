# ZillowEstimationProject--LinearModel-Application
The data comes from a competition on Kaggle. Zillow is asking you to predict the log-error between their Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home. Data and instructions are on the website https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data. Here the objective is to do exploratory data analylsis, build a simple linear model and a multiple linear model to compare the two.
